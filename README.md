The Knightâ€™s Travails
=====================

Given a standard 8x8 chessboard, design an application that accepts two squares
identified by algebraic chess notation. The first square is the starting position, and the second square
is the ending position. Find the shortest sequence of valid moves to take a Knight piece from the
starting position to the ending position. Each move must be a legal move by a Knight and you can
assume there are no other pieces on the board. For any two squares there may be more than one
valid solution.

Algebraic chess notation identifies each square with a
letter from A to H and a number from 1 to 8. The
columns are labelled with letters, and the rows are
numbered. The lower left is A1.

Example

Test Input:                      A8 B7
Expected Output:                 C7 B5 D6 B7
